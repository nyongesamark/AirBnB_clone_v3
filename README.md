# AirBnB Clone - The Console

The console is the initial component of the AirBnB project at Holberton School, which encompasses fundamental concepts of higher-level programming. The AirBnB projectâ€™s objective is to ultimately launch a simple version of the AirBnB website. A command interpreter is developed in this segment to manage objects for the AirBnB website.

###Functionalities of this command interpreter:
Create new objects (e.g., a new User or Place)
Retrieve objects from various sources (e.g., files or databases)
Perform operations on objects (e.g., counting or computing statistics)
Update object attributes
Destroy objects
